Ban bypass. I'm hopeless for the future of this site. (WORKING)

# Exploit counter (found by "me")

# Right so how does this one work?

Well, you see, the only thing stopping you from playing on wild when banned is a ban screen.

So, just remove the ban screen? Obviously lol.

# Im lost how the fuck did you find this one

My customer was using an auto-joiner on an account that was banned, and noticed that the account was still able to join battles.

So we tested with more and more gamemodes, and it turns out that this works with every single gamemode that happens over the socket.

# Tutorial

### Step 1:

Go to RBLXWild on a banned account of your choice, and open devtools (inspect element, developer tools, whatever you want to call it)

### Step 2:

Head over to the sources tab:

Then find this JS file

After that, CTRL+F and search this:

Now refresh...

If you see this, then it is going well.

Store "t" as a global variable:

Switch to console, if you see this, it means it's working.

So `temp1` is the name of your site variable.

Now type `temp1.user.isBanned = 0`, then press the blue thing on your debugger to unpause the site.
